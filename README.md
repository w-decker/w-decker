Hi!

My name is Will Decker. I am an undergraduate student researcher.

Most notably, my interests and passions fall within the category of [neuroinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroinformatics). I am interested in neuroimaging techniques (MRI, EEG, MEG, etc.) and their respective analyses as well as improvements to said analyses. I am also intrigued by how the brain can be broken down computationally and how this understanding influences data science techniques like image and signal processing and other fascinating computational tools like multi-voxel pattern analysis. Additionally, I am severely interested in and passionate about statistics, language processing/linguistics, the structure-function relationship, open science, and coding.
