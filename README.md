Hi!

My name is Will Decker. I am an undergraduate student researcher.

Most notably, my interests and passions fall within the categories of statistics for cognitive neuroscience, [neuroinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroinformatics) and neuroimaging. I am interested in neuroimaging techniques (MRI, EEG, MEG, etc.) and their respective analyses as well as improvements to their analyses. I am also intrigued by how the brain can be broken down computationally and how this understanding influences data science techniques like image and signal processing and other fascinating computational tools like multi-voxel pattern analysis. I also am interested in applying statistical models to cognitive domains and using neuroinformatics to study cognition. Additionally, I am severely interested in and passionate about language processing/linguistics, the structure-function relationship, open science, and coding.
