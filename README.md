Hi!

My name is Will Decker. I am an undergraduate student researcher.

Most notably, my interests and passions fall within the categories of cognitive neuroscience, statistics, [neuroinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroinformatics) and neuroimaging. I am interested in neuroimaging techniques (MRI, EEG, MEG, etc.) and their respective analyses as well as improvements to their analyses. I am also intrigued by how the brain can be broken down computationally and how this understanding influences data science techniques like image and signal processing and other fascinating computational tools like multi-voxel pattern analysis. I intend to apply statistical modeling and neuroinformatics to study cognitiion. I am particularly interested in language, how the human language network paralells that of a machine, and how we use language to understand the world around us. Additionally, I am severely interested in and passionate about language processing/linguistics, the structure-function relationship, open science, and coding.
