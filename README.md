Hello!

My name is Will Decker. I am an undergraduate student researcher.

My research interests cover a large spectrum within the fields of psychology, neuroscience and data science. I am primarily interested in neuroimaging techniques (MRI, EEG, MEG, etc.) and their respective analyses as well as improvements to said analyses. I am also intrigued by how the brain can be broken down computationally and how this understanding influences data science techniques like image and signal processing. With the aforementioned interests in mind, I further intend to study language processing in the brain. Other topics that I am passionate about: statistics, the structure-function relationship, open science, and coding.
