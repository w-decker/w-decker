Hello

My name is Will Decker. I am an undergraduate student researcher.

My research interests cover a large spectrum within the fields of psychology, neuropsychology, neuroscience, and data science. I am primarily interested in using a multimodal neuroimaging approach to investigate brain structure and brain function and how both influence psychopathology and cognition. I am also interested in how machine learning can be used to enhance and optimize clinical outcomes for acquired brain injuries and neurodegenerative disorders. I am also generally interested in neuroimaging, programming, neuromodulation/neurostimulation, biomarkers and statistics.
