Hello

My name is Will Decker. I am an undergraduate student researcher.

My research interests cover a large spectrum within the fields of psychology, neuropsychology, neuroscience, and data science. I am primarily interested in using a multimodal neuroimaging approach to investigate brain structure and brain function and how both influence cognition, neuropathology, and behavior. I am further interested in how statistics and machine learning approaches can be used to enhance and optimize our understanding of cognition, neuropathology, and behavior. I also have a serious interest in neuroimaging, programming, “big data”, neuromodulation/neurostimulation, and biomarkers.
