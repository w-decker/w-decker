Hello

My name is Will Decker. I am an undergraduate student researcher.

My research interests cover a large spectrum within the fields of psychology, neuroscience and data science. I am primarily interested in neuroimaging techniques (MRI, EEG, MEG, etc.) and their respective analyses. I am also intrigued by how the brain can be broken down computationally and how this understanding influences neuroimaging analyses. Other topics that I am passionate about are statistics, the structure-function relationship, open science, and coding.
